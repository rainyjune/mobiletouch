      <p>Every night I find it's so hard to sleep
      <p>'Cause I keep thinking of you
      <p>And these feelings run deep
      <p>Oh baby Itry to hide
      <p>All these feelings for you
      <p>I keep them battled inside
      <p>I don't know what else to do
      <p>So I cry and nobody hears me
      <p>I cry,it's my only solution
      <p>I cry,to all this confusion
      <p>I cry, with all of my heart
      <p>I cry

      <p>Sometimes I wonder
      <p>In the blink of my eye
      <p>Would you be willing to love me
      <p>Would you give it a try
      <p>I don't know how else to show you
      <p>That our love could be real
      <p>I'd be eternally faithfull
      <p>Forever I'd feel
      <p>So I cry and nobody hears me
      <p>I cry,it's my only solution
      <p>I cry,to all this confusion
      <p>I cry, with all of my heart
      <p>I cry

      <p>No one can tell me that I may be wrong
      <p>'Cause I know in my heart
      <p>This feeling's still burning strong
      <p>Can't get you out of my head
      <p>Can't get you out of my heart
      <p>Can't get you out of my life
      <p>No matter if we're apart
      <p>So I cry and nobody hears me
      <p>I cry,it's my only solution
      <p>I cry,to all this confusion
      <p>I cry, with all of my heart
      <p>I cry
      <p>And nobody hears me
      <p>I cry,it's my only solution
      <p>I cry,to all this confusion
      <p>I cry, with all of my heart
      <p>I cry
